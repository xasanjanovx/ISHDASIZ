# Canvas Design Guide

Create beautiful visual art in PDF and PNG documents using design philosophy principles.

## When to Use

- Creating posters or visual art
- Designing static visual pieces
- Building abstract compositions
- Generating museum-quality graphics
- Creating coffee table book pages

## Two-Step Process

1. **Design Philosophy** - Create aesthetic framework (.md)
2. **Canvas Creation** - Express it visually (.pdf or .png)

## Design Philosophy Creation

Create a VISUAL PHILOSOPHY that will be interpreted through:

- Form, space, color, composition
- Images, graphics, shapes, patterns
- Minimal text as visual accent

### Philosophy Structure

**Name the Movement** (1-2 words):

- "Brutalist Joy"
- "Chromatic Silence"
- "Metabolist Dreams"

**Articulate the Philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs):

- Space and form
- Color and material
- Scale and rhythm
- Composition and balance
- Visual hierarchy

### Example Philosophies

| Name | Expression |
|------|------------|
| Concrete Poetry | Monumental form, bold geometry, Brutalist spatial divisions |
| Chromatic Language | Color zones create meaning, minimal typography |
| Analog Meditation | Paper grain, vast negative space, photography dominant |
| Organic Systems | Rounded forms, natural clustering, modular growth |
| Geometric Silence | Grid precision, dramatic negative space |

## Canvas Creation

### Essential Principles

- **90% visual, 10% essential text**
- Repeating patterns and perfect shapes
- Limited, cohesive color palette
- Dense accumulation rewarding sustained viewing
- Expert-level craftsmanship

### Typography Rules

- Text is sparse and essential-only
- Use thin fonts most of the time
- Font becomes part of the art
- Nothing overlaps or falls off page
- Proper margins and breathing room

### Quality Standards

Create work that appears:

- Labored over with painstaking care
- Product of countless hours
- Master-level execution
- Ready for museum display

## Color Palettes

| Style | Colors |
|-------|--------|
| Anthropic | Dark #141413, Light #faf9f5, Orange #d97757 |
| Corporate | Navy, Silver, Accent |
| Natural | Earth tones, greens, warm neutrals |
| Bold | High contrast, saturated primaries |

## Output

- Design philosophy as .md file
- Final art as .pdf or .png file
- Single page unless multiple requested

## Refinement

After first pass:

- Avoid adding more graphics
- Refine existing composition
- Make it extremely crisp
- Respect minimalism principles
